                  Integrating Eukaryotic Plankton Community Transcriptomics into an Ecological Network Analysis of the Neuse River Estuary
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Eutrophication of estuarine and coastal systems can often result in harmful algal blooms (HABs), hypoxia and fish kills. Non-point sources of pollution in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE) watershed have been increasing as the area has experienced steady growth in agriculture, industry and urbanization. Efforts to reduce nutrient inputs of phosphorus have had positive results; however, similar efforts for nitrogen input reduction have not been as successful. Necessary to the effective management of this ecosystem are the identification of the abiotic and biotic components of the system and subsequent understanding of the relationships of those components. The aim of this project is to provide insight into bloom dynamics, causes, and effects, and to provide new molecular tools that may aid in forecasting HABs. We seek to build ecological relationships between the plankton communities incorporating transcriptomic (analysis of RNA sequences) data from eukaryotic phytoplankton. The utilization of next generation sequencing technologies will provide high-resolution of biotic components of this ecosystem. These data will be contextualized with environmental data routinely collected by the ModMon monitoring program in the NRE, such as chlorophyll a, particulate organic matter, primary productivity and dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients. The coupling of these data, with an emphasis on nitrogen cycling, will elucidate important ecological networks that can then be used to guide best management practices to promote healthy ecosystems.  The models, approaches, and tools produced by this study could be expandable to other coastal and estuarine systems.

                  Iron and Vitamin Interactions in Diatoms
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Iron and B-vitamins can play important roles in regulating the growth of bacteria and protist phytoplankton in our oceans, yet it is not well understood how they respond when faced with simultaneous iron and vitamin stress. Although most phytoplankton, including diatoms, can synthesize some B-vitamins (e.g. biotin [B7]), other vitamins may only be supplied to phytoplankton through bacterial production (e.g. cobalamin [B12]), possibly resulting in vitamin exchanges between these microorganisms. This study aims to understand the interactions between iron and B-vitamin limitation within laboratory diatom cultures and natural phytoplankton assemblages along a natural iron gradient in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The pairing of complementary approaches including physiological measurements, dissolved B-vitamin concentrations, and community transcriptomics provides us with a better understanding of phytoplankton responses to variations in iron and vitamin availability, which ultimately may be controlling plankton community composition, primary production, and nutrient cycling in this region as well as in other iron-limited regions throughout the globe.

                  Investigating an Ecological Role for Iron Storage in Diatoms            
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  A fundamental goal in phytoplankton ecology is to identify environmental factors that control phytoplankton distribution and abundance. In 30-40% of the world’s oceans, phytoplankton growth is limited by availability of the micronutrient iron. Addition of iron to surface waters in these regions induces massive phytoplankton blooms dominated primarily by large, mostly pennate diatoms. This suggests that the diatoms able to bloom in response to these sporadic iron deliveries are able to rapidly take up and store iron, permitting continued divisions once the chronically low iron concentrations return. Many animals, plants and bacteria store iron through highly specialized iron storage proteins known as ferritins.  Recently, ferritin-encoding genes were discovered within the bloom-forming pennate diatoms, marking the first description of ferritin in any member of the Stramenopiles, a diverse Eukaryotic lineage that includes unicellular algae, macroalgae and plant parasites. However, it is not known whether there are systematic differences in iron-storage capacities between ferritin-containing diatoms and those that lack ferritin.  The overall objective of this project is to examine the ecological importance of iron storage as a selective mechanism controlling the distributions of diatoms along natural and artificial iron gradients in oceanic and coastal marine ecosystems.  Through a combination of laboratory and field studies we will determine the ability of oceanic and coastal diatoms that either contain or lack ferritin to perform luxury uptake of iron and utilize these iron stores in the absence of an external source of iron to maintain growth and out compete other members of the phytoplankton assemblage. In the laboratory we are investigating the iron storage capacities within a variety of ferritin containing and non-containing oceanic and coastal diatoms.  In the field we are partaking on two cruises, one to the California Current System in July of 2014 to examine iron storage capacities in coastal diatom communities and the other to Ocean Station Papa in the Northeast Pacific Ocean in June of 2015 to evaluate iron storage capacities in oceanic diatom communities.

                  Iron and Light Limitation in Southern Ocean Diatoms: Comparative Transcriptomics and Molecular Indicators
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text"> The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica is changing rapidly in response to Earth’s warming climate. These changes will undoubtedly influence communities of primary producers by altering conditions that influence their growth and composition. Because primary producers such as phytoplankton play an important role in global biogeochemical cycling, it is essential to understand how they will respond to changes in their environment. The growth of phytoplankton in certain regions of the Southern Ocean is constrained by steep gradients in chemical and physical properties that vary in both space and time. Light and iron have been identified as key variables influencing phytoplankton abundance and distribution within Antarctic waters. Microscopic algae known as diatoms are dominant members of the phytoplankton and sea ice communities, accounting for significant proportions of primary production. The overall objective of this project is to identify the molecular bases for the physiological responses of polar diatoms to varying light and iron conditions. The project should provide a means of evaluating the extent these factors regulate diatom growth and influence net community productivity in Antarctic waters.  Although numerous studies have investigated how polar diatoms are affected by varying light and iron, the cellular mechanisms leading to their distinct physiological responses remain unknown. Using comparative transcriptomics, the expression patterns of key genes and metabolic pathways in several ecologically important polar diatoms recently isolated from Antarctic waters and grown under varying iron and irradiance conditions will be examined.  In addition, molecular indicators for iron and light limitation will be developed within these polar diatoms through the identification of iron- and light-responsive genes — the expression patterns of which can be used to determine their physiological status. Upon verification in laboratory cultures, these indicators will be utilized by way of metatranscriptomic sequencing to examine iron and light limitation in natural diatom assemblages collected along environmental gradients in Western Antarctic Peninsula waters. In order to fully understand the role phytoplankton play in Southern Ocean biogeochemical cycles, dependable methods that provide a means of elucidating the physiological status of phytoplankton at any given time and location are essential.
